# Heap Data Structures Assignment

This project contains the implementation of the Heapsort algorithm and a Priority Queue using a binary heap.

## Files

- `heapsort.py`: Implements Heapsort using a max-heap.
- `priority_queue.py`: Implements a priority queue with insert, extract, change priority, and is_empty operations.
- `efficiency_tests.py`: Tests the performance of Heapsort and priority queue operations.
- `README.md`: Project information.

## How to Run

Use Python to run the files from the terminal or in VS Code.

```bash
python heapsort.py
python priority_queue.py
python efficiency_tests.py
